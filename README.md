#Numerical and Symbolic Computation Experiment: LU decomposition and QR decom-
- Developed matrix LU decomposition algorithm using C++ language, and used gaussian elimina-
tion method to calculate linear algebraic equations.
- Developed matrix QR decomposition algorithm using C++ language and Hessenberg transform
that can calculate linear algebraic equations.
